This is a blackjack made with python. Made 4 days after learning python. 

DOCS:
  - This file runs with python3 or more (3.5.0/3.7.2/3.7.0 etc)
  - To execute the file run "python app.py" in your terminal :)
  - The program is made with OOP
  
The blackjack is played in the following way:
  - The console will ask you what to do:
    - Options:
    - Hit me! - You will throw a card
    - Pass - You will end your turn
  - If you get a score higher than 21 the turn will pass to the next player automatically
  - If an Npc gets a score higher than 21 the same will happen
  - There is a tracker of wins for every player, to see it just type "wins"
  - If you get a 21 you will win the round automatically
  - If the house loses all (score >21) players will win the round automatically
  - You can choose the number of players you want
  - SAVE GAME IS NOT FUNCTIONAL YET
  - Stop the game with cntrl + C or type "exit" in the console when asked what to do
